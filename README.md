# DATA607_Project_2_Data_Transformation

**Author:** Kevin Martin  
**Course:** DATA 607 â€“ Data Acquisition & Management  
**Date:** October 5, 2025  

This project demonstrates how to transform wide datasets into tidy formats using R and the `tidyverse` package. It focuses on reshaping data, summarizing results, and exporting clean datasets ready for analysis or visualization.

### ðŸ§© Datasets Used
- **Sales Data:** Monthly product sales  
- **Scores Data:** Student performance by subject  
- **Vaccinations Data:** Regional vaccination progress over months  

### ðŸ§° Key Concepts
- Data reshaping using `pivot_longer()`
- Handling missing values with `replace_na()`
- Creating summaries using `group_by()` and `summarise()`
- Exporting clean data tables to CSV for future use  

### ðŸ“Š Outputs
All generated tidy tables and summary CSV files can be found in the `outputs/` folder.  
A zipped version (`project2_outputs.zip`) is also included for convenience.

### ðŸ’¡ Reflection
This project helped me understand how to convert complex, wide data into manageable long formats. I learned how to structure R Markdown files, handle CSV creation, and troubleshoot file path issues â€” valuable skills for real-world data work.
